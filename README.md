### What?
Next JPH is an example app made with [JsonPlaceholder](http://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/) api, using [Next.js](http://github.com/zeit/next.js), [styled-components](http://github.com/styled-components/styled-components), [flow](http://github.com/facebook/flow) and [jest](http://github.com/facebook/jest).  

*"JPH" is an acronym to **J**son**P**lace**h**older.*
  
**See the app running at `now`**: http://jph.now.sh

### Why?
This is a project I've made to learn more about the used stack.  
Also, is a good reference to newcommers in these technologies.  

Feel free to contribute if you find any mistake I've made, or if you want to improve the application.
